# About Me:
Hi! My name is Julien Bessin. 
I am currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science as a junior at UChicago!<br>

I am patient, assertive, perseverant, and a very rigorous learner. My interests span networks, browsers, machine learning, OS, computer architecture, and cybersecurity.<br>

I believe that in the age of Artifical Intelligence, much of Software Engineering will be automated, so there will be higher value in understanding the systems on which tools like Angular, React, or Django run, than being very good at using them. I am a member of AI@UChicago, learning about and developing elements of neural networks, CNNs, and transformers.<br>

I have an ambition to enter the world of cybersecurity. I wish to exploit my tendency and desire to understand new technologies to their most minute details (I created a web browser from scratch in Python this summer: HTML, CCS, JS, cookies, and data security), and transform this strength into usefulness by making technologies on which society relies stronger and more trustworthy. I frequently consult cybsersecurity news and love networking with security professionals.
